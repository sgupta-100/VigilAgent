CHRONOMANCER (Architecture §9.3 — race condition / time-bound logic flaw).

Hardened gating (Architecture §17, §25):
  * ``preconditions_met`` requires a date/time-bound resource signal —
    a redeem/coupon/claim/withdraw/transfer/buy keyword in the URL OR a
    payload field that names a quantity/price/coupon/voucher/expires/start_at/
    end_at field. Without this signal Chronomancer does NOT confirm a race
    condition on the wrong endpoint type (e.g. /sqli/, /xss_r/, /brute/).
  * Wrong-class suppression: any captured response that clearly carries
    SQLI/XSS/CMDI/LFI/JWT evidence drops the finding.
