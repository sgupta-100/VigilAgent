"""
THE SKIPPER (Architecture §9.3 — workflow-bypass logic flaw).

Tightened so it only fires when there is actual evidence of a multi-step state
machine being bypassed. Previously, this module emitted CONFIRMED findings on
any endpoint whose response body happened to contain the word "success" or
"welcome" — DVWA's `/brute/` login form returns "Welcome to the password
protected area" on the failure page, which tripped the heuristic.

The hardened logic requires:
  1) the orchestrator/recon must have flagged this endpoint as part of a
     multi-step workflow (`packet.config.params['workflow_steps']` populated
     by Cortex), OR the URL must contain an obvious workflow-step keyword
     (checkout/payment/confirm/success/order/wizard/step), AND
  2) the response carries POST-WORKFLOW positive markers AND the baseline
     (a fetch without spoofed Referer) does NOT, AND
  3) we observe a meaningful structural divergence between the baseline and
     the bypass attempt (>=1 verifier signal).

Without all three, this module returns no findings.

Architecture §17/§25 reinforcement:
  * ``preconditions_met`` is the explicit gate. ``generate_payloads`` AND
    ``analyze_responses`` both bail when it fails — defending against the
    case where the orchestrator hands the module pre-built interactions.
  * If any captured response body clearly belongs to a DIFFERENT vuln class
    (SQL error, /etc/passwd, executable XSS reflection, CMDI output) the
    module suppresses any finding it produced. Skipper MUST NOT confirm a
    workflow bypass on /brute/, /sqli/, /fi/, /xss_r/, /exec/.
