"""
broadcast_throttle.py — coalescing helper for the orchestrator's WebSocket
broadcast hot path.

WHY: During a real scan the orchestrator's ``event_listener`` emits ~10
``manager.broadcast(...)`` calls per ``VULN_CONFIRMED``. We routinely see
1500+ such events per scan, which is enough to saturate the
``SocketManager._process_batch_queue`` even though the UI only needs the
*latest* per (type, url, agent) within a short window.

WHAT: ``BroadcastThrottle.should_emit(key)`` returns ``True`` the first time
a key is seen and ``False`` while the same key is still inside its window.
Internally we keep an O(1) FIFO ``deque`` of ``(key, expiry_ts)`` tuples
and a parallel ``dict`` for fast lookup, evicting expired entries lazily on
each call. No background task, no locks — the listener is single-consumer
per scan (see EventBus._scan_event_loop) so the data structure does not
need to be thread-safe.

USAGE:
    throttle = BroadcastThrottle(window_ms=500)
    if throttle.should_emit(("LIVE_THREAT_LOG", url, agent)):
        await manager.broadcast(...)

Behavior is documented + opt-in: the throttle is bypassed if you pass
``window_ms=0``, which keeps the legacy "broadcast every event" semantics
for tests that assert on broadcast counts.
