Vigilagent Commander Agents (Architecture §5)
================================================================================
Budgeted commander agents that own a domain of the campaign and delegate bounded
work to specialized children/workers through the DelegationManager.

  NetworkServiceCommander - port/service/TLS assessment (L4/L6/L7, §29.7)

This module also registers in-process child runners with the DelegationManager
(Architecture §5.1.2) so commanders can spawn bounded network-assessment tasks.
